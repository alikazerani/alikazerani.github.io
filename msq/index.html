        <p>I recently worked on the problem of searching for 3-by-3 magic squares containing at least seven perfect-square entries.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An example of such a square is already known, but no other examples have been found beyond scalar multiples and permutations of this instance.</li>
            <li>I carried out my search by programmatically listing certain potentially useful arithmetic sequences, then grouping and combining these to try to construct magic squares of interest.</li>
            <li>Some development notes:
                <ul>
                    <li>I used <a href="https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html">SymPy</a> with Python to help perform an initial linear algebraic reduction, to find useful patterns in collections of algebraic expressions and numerical sequences, and to symbolically and numerically verify elements of my C++ code, which I discuss next.</li>
                    <li>I wrote, repeatedly improved and varied, tested, and ran programs in C++ to carry out the (computationally intensive) numerical search.
                        <ul>
                            <li>I experimented with (for example) various approaches to managing and manipulating large collections of data of various widths, both in memory and on disk, different approaches for concurrency, and different methods for generating source sequences.</li>
                            <li>I got to explore a good portion of the standard library, including a few modern C++ features.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>I used Git for version control.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>I ended up exploring a search space roughly as large as 64-bit unsigned integer data and operations would allow, with square entries up to the order of 1,000,000,000,000,000,000.  Wider data types are available, but I also faced constraints associated with hard drive capacity, memory, processor speed, and time reasonably available for execution and development.</li>
            <li>My final run took roughly 6.5 hours to complete.  It hit 2,352,941 instances in the already-known family of solutions, but sadly no completely alien results.</li>
            <li>At the risk of sounding like an off-podium finisher: The true value of this project was as a personal endeavour and as a programming exercise and demonstration.  This value is independent both of whether a fresh solution could be found (or even exists) and of any other searchers' progress and methods.</li>
        </ul>
