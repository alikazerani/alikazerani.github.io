        <p>I am currently working on a problem concerning magic squares.  I may provide details once this little project concludes, but for now, please allow me to be a little vague:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I am searching for magic squares of a particular form.</li>
            <li>The objects I am searching for are not even guaranteed to exist.</li>
            <li>The search is computationally intensive.</li>
            <li>I used <a href="https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html">SymPy</a> with Python to help perform an initial algebraic reduction, to find useful patterns in sets of algebraic expressions as well as in numerical sequences, and to symbolically and numerically verify elements of the C++ code discussed below.</li>
            <li>I have written (and continue to write, improve, test, and run) C++ programs to carry out the steps of the core numerical search.
                <ul>
                    <li>I am currently executing one stage of the search over a freshly expanded space.  This run should take twenty days, after which I will be able to run the downstream stages.</li>
                    <li>For some tasks, I have implemented a couple of alternatives (e.g., memory-centered vs disk-centered, and using alternative approaches for concurrency).</li>
                    <li>From the standard library, I have been using containers, algorithms, smart pointers, futures (via async calls), threads, mutexes, condition variables, clocks, file streams, filesystem utilities, mathematical functions, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>I am using Git for version control.</li>
        </ul>
