        <p>I am currently working on a problem concerning magic squares.  I may provide details once this little project concludes, but for now, please allow me to be a little vague:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I am searching for magic squares of a particular form.</li>
            <li>The objects I am searching for are not even guaranteed to exist.</li>
            <li>The search is computationally intensive.</li>
            <li>I used <a href="https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html">SymPy</a> with Python to help perform an initial algebraic reduction, to find useful patterns in sets of algebraic expressions as well as in numerical sequences, and to symbolically and numerically verify elements of the C++ code discussed below.</li>
            <li>I have written (and continue to write, improve, test, and run) C++ programs to carry out the steps of the core numerical search.
                <ul>
                    <li>I am currently executing one stage of the search over a freshly expanded space.  This run should take twenty days, after which I will be able to run the downstream stages.</li>
                    <li>For some tasks, I have implemented a couple of alternatives (e.g., memory-centered vs disk-centered, and using alternative approaches for concurrency).</li>
                    <li>From the standard library, I have been using containers, algorithms, smart pointers, futures (via async calls), threads, mutexes, condition variables, clocks, file streams, filesystem utilities, mathematical functions, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>I am using Git for version control.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>[9 September 2022]</p>
        <p>I found a far more efficient method for conducting the first stage of the search!  I therefore stopped the long search run mentioned above, implemented the new approach, made considerable changes to the implementation of the second stage, and performed some experiments, tests, and runs.  While I have additional tweaks and extensions in mind, I do intend to have both stages run (at least) overnight tonight, covering a very large search space.</p>

        <p>[20 September 2022]</p>
        <p>I ran the search as intended (during the morning of 10 September).  No solutions dissimilar to the already-known solution were found.  (I will re-check the mathematical expressions in my implementation.)  Expanding the search space by a further order of magnitude would necessitate not only a longer execution time, but also wider data types, more storage, and additional changes to my implementation.  Available disk space will very soon present an insurmountable obstacle, but I have partially coded a new implementation that would permit at least some expansion of the search space.  I hope to return to that work soon, and possibly also try alternative approaches if necessary.</p>
