        <h3>Summary</h3>

        <p>To help me take pictures of my small, distant relatives with my smartphone, I created an Android camera app that features focus autobracketing.  This page includes some of the pictures I have taken using the app.</p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>I often find that my smartphone (Sony Xperia XA) camera fails to focus automatically or semi-automatically on my intended subjects &mdash; insects, for instance.  By switching from automatic to manual focus and selecting the macro extreme, I can ensure that the camera will focus on objects that are quite close to the lens.  However, since decreasing the focus distance also decreases the depth of field, only a small region of space may be effectively brought into focus at the macro setting, and a subject in macro focus may be taken noticeably out of focus through only a slight perturbation in the distance between the camera and the subject.  This, combined with the difficulty of accurately gauging image quality and sharpness from the smartphone's displayed live camera preview, makes it nearly impossible to reliably capture acceptable pictures of small subjects by taking isolated shots at macro focus.</p>  
        
        <p>Therefore, instead of taking a single picture of each subject, I decided to take a sequence of pictures, all at different distances from the subject, while keeping the camera's focus distance fixed at macro.  This often produces at least one reasonably focused/sharp image of the subject.  (A similar, alternative approach is to keep the camera at a fixed distance from the subject while manually sliding the focus distance from macro outward.  However, it is difficult to vary the focus distance quickly and finely by hand using the slider in the stock camera app.  Also, typically, the proportion of the whole frame occupied by the in-focus subject will be smaller &mdash; and the level of subject detail captured consequently inferior &mdash; if focus is attained by varying the focus distance rather than the distance to the subject.)</p>
        
        <p>Unfortunately, this approach has significant disadvantages.  The process is lengthy, and many live animal subjects are understandably reluctant to remain motionless indefinitely.  Moreover, the sight of a nearby smartphone being moved back and forth by a large stranger may get to be too much for an easily frightened insect.  The process is also clumsy.  The photographer may take several shots at similar distances, waste shots and time at useless distances, and miss useful distances.  (My device sometimes simply fails to capture or save a requested shot.)</p>
        
        <h3>My App</h3>

        <p>I wound up contemplating an automated version of the alternative approach in which the distance to the subject is fixed while the focus distance is varied.  I learned that this has a name: focus autobracketing.  The <a href="https://opencamera.org.uk/">OpenCamera</a> app actually includes this capability, but only for smartphones whose cameras may be controlled through the Camera2 API.  My relatively primitive smartphone only provides control through the older Camera API, which does not generally allow one to set a particular focus distance.  Since my phone's stock camera app does allow the user to manually set the focus distance on a slider, I wondered if another app could similarly access the associated setting.  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63932162/setting-camera-focus-distance-in-android">Someone kindly suggested</a> how I could try capturing the parameter names and values set in my particular device under manual focus.  This did indeed reveal the name of the relevant Sony-specific (if not device-specific) parameter (<code>sony-manual-focus</code>) along with some of its possible values.</p>

        <p>With this key in hand, I proceeded to program a relatively simple app from scratch, to perform focus autobracketing on my smartphone.  I worked in the Android Studio IDE and coded in Java (and a little XML).  Guides including <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/camera">the official Android Camera API guide</a> gave me an excellent introduction, and <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera">the complete official documentation</a> was of course crucial.  While I had never before worked on a smartphone app or programmed in Java (though I did used to code in C#), I quite enjoyed working on this project.</p>

        <p>I named the app FABCam (for <u>F</u>ocus <u>A</u>uto<u>b</u>racketing <u>Cam</u>era).  Figure 1 shows a screenshot of it in action.</p>

        <div style="width: 60vw; margin: auto;"><img src="screenshot/annotated.png" style="width: 60vw; object-fit: scale-down;"></div>
        <div class="figure_caption"><b>Figure 1.</b>  A screenshot showing FABCam's on-screen interface.  The damselfly seen in the live preview is the subject of the shots.</div>

        <p>The app begins a sequence of shots when the user releases the smartphone's physical camera button.  (The user may later prematurely stop a sequence by the same action.)  Before thus initiating a sequence, the user may use the on-screen interface shown in the figure to select the number of successive shots to be taken, as well as the focus distances for the first and last shots.  While the user is setting each of these focus distance extremes on a slider, the live preview shows the scene viewed with that focus distance.  When the user releases these controls, the live preview reflects a focus distance intermediate between the selected starting and ending values.  The user may also set the camera's white balance and exposure compensation, and they may switch between the main and selfie cameras.  (Within a session, the app remembers the user's settings for one camera when they switch to the other camera, should they later choose to switch back.)  All images are captured and saved at the active camera's maximum resolution.</p>

        <h3>Some Sequences I Captured With Focus Autobracketing</h3>

        <p>With the settings shown in Figure 1, I captured a focus-bracketed sequence of shots of that damselfly.  Figure 2 shows that with increasing focus distance, the region in focus moves from the front of the head in the first shot, to the bulk of the animal (including the bulk of the thorax, the legs, the proximal parts of the wings, and the anterior part of the abdomen) in the second shot, to the posterior part of the insect (including the tips of the wings) in the third shot.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="figure_caption"><b>Figure 2.</b> Three successive shots from a focus-autobracketed sequence of a damselfly.<br />(To best show this progression, I used MATLAB to apply projective transformations to align the first and third images with the second, with respect to several control points that I selected in each image, thereby roughly compensating for unintended changes in the position and orientation of the handheld smartphone relative to the subject.  I placed the control points on the plant, not on the animal, to avoid erroneously attempting to compensate for changes in the damselfly's posture by distorting its image.  I also cropped the three registered images.  You can see the original &#8212 untransformed and uncropped &#8212 sequence of images <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/UbX7RWWE93XHAriu6">here</a>.)</div>

        <p>From such a focus-bracketed sequence, one can then choose whichever image (or set of images) best shows the feature(s) of interest.  It should also be possible in some cases to effectively extend the depth of field (i.e., show a deeper region in focus) by focus-stacking (z-stacking) a sequence of focus-bracketed images.</p>

        <p>A similar sequence that I captured of a katydid is shown in Figure 3.</p>

        <h3>Some Individual Shots I Captured Using Focus Autobracketing</h3>

        <p>With the year's onset of cool and cold temperatures approaching, I went out and used my app to capture these and a few other sequences of focus-autobracketed pictures.  In Figure 4, I show a selection of individual shots from these sequences.  (Cropping aside, these images are identical to the captured originals.)</p>

        <h3>Notes and Observations</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>When setting up for a sequence of focus-autobracketed shots of a subject, the photographer should obviously choose initial and final focus distances that fairly tightly surround the whole interval of desired focus distances, and choose the number of shots in the sequence so that the difference between focus distances in two consecutive shots is no greater than the minimum depth of field at those focus distances.  In this way, the whole region of interest will be brought into reasonable focus across the complete sequence of shots.<ul>
                <li>If one takes too few shots in a sequence, some features of interest may not be in focus in any of the captured images.</li>
                <li>If one demands too many shots in a sequence, successive images may be essentially redundant.  Also, the sequence may take so long to shoot that the subject will move during the sequence, possibly leaving altogether.  (If the subject moves toward or away from the camera throughout the sequence, it is possible that no shot in the sequence will bring the features of interest into focus.)</li><br />

                <div class="figure_caption"><b>Figure 5.</b> This butterfly ran out of patience with me during the two-second interval between the eighth (top) and ninth (bottom) shots of a focus-autobracketed sequence.</div>
                <div style="width: 40vw; margin: auto;"><img src="other_images/snail_with_someplace_to_be.jpg" style="width: 40vw; object-fit: scale-down;"></div>
                <div class="figure_caption"><b>Figure 6.</b> This snail showed no interest in sitting still during the 23 seconds between the first and tenth shots of a focus-autobracketed sequence.</div>
                <li>If the photographer positions the camera too close to (too far from) the subject or overestimates (underestimates) the shortest (longest) desired focus distance, the features of interest may be entirely out of focus in every shot in the sequence.  While the nearest-focused (farthest-focused) shot would be the best of the bunch, even it may not be acceptable.  In Figure 4, the image of the insect on the sidewalk was the first and nearest-focused shot in a sequence, all subsequent shots having placed him entirely out of focus, and the image of the mating damselflies was the final and farthest-focused shot in a sequence, all prior shots having placed them entirely out of focus.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>If a subject (e.g., a bee foraging at a cluster of flowers) is expected to move (perhaps unpredictably) toward or away from the camera, the initial and final focus distances could both be set to the same suitable value in the app, and a sequence of shots with the same focus distance thus taken.  The subject would then hopefully be in focus in at least one of the captured shots.</li>
            <li>While developing and testing the app, I often found that the first image in a sequence would appear normal, while all subsequent images in the sequence would be overexposed, showing saturation.  It appears that the camera always establishes an appropriate exposure level anew after a picture is taken.  This process takes time to complete, so that if a picture is taken too soon after another, the exposure setting may then be at an in-transient level, resulting in an unacceptable image.  I tried setting the camera's auto-exposure and auto-white-balance lock states helpfully via the Camera API (through <code>setAutoExposureLock</code> and <code>setAutoWhiteBalanceLock</code>), but these do not appear to provide a path toward solving the problem.  Following some experimentation (see Figures 7 and 8), I decided that an added delay of 1.5 seconds between shots was appropriate to resolve this issue, and this fix is in place in the current implementation.  It is unfortunate that the intervals between successive shots, and therefore the time needed to complete each sequence, must be thus significantly lengthened.  (I am considering reducing the added delay to a similarly effective but somewhat less pathologically prudent value.)</li><br />

            <div class="figure_caption"><b>Figure 7.</b> With the autoexposure routine having already converged, a sequence's first shot (a) is captured at an appropriate exposure level.  If a subsequent shot (b) is taken almost immediately after its predecessor, the re-started autoexposure routine may not yet have converged to a reasonable setting, resulting in an unacceptable &mdash; possibly saturated &mdash; image.  Even slightly extending the delay between successive shots gives the autoexposure routine time to converge to a more reasonable setting, producing a more acceptable image (c).  A very long delay produces the best possible result (d).</div>

            <div class="figure_caption"><b>Figure 8.</b> The results of this particular experiment may be summarized in a plot.  Delays ranging from 0.16 s to 3.00 s were added between successive shots taken of the same scene and at the same focus distance.  Each post-delay image was converted to grayscale, the mean of the resulting pixel intensities computed, and this mean divided by the mean for the very first image in the sequence.  These relative mean image intensities are here plotted (as points) against the corresponding added delay times.  The dotted line corresponds to the first (ostensibly normal) image.  The dotted line and points corresponding to sample images (a) through (d) from Figure 7 are indicated on the plot.  The results shown are from a single rough experimental run.  I held the smartphone in my hands to capture the shots, so the position and orientation of the camera relative to the world was not quite fixed over the course of the run.  The resulting changes in the photographed region, along with changing cloud cover, the effects of any breezes on the plant(s) in the scene, and variability in the performance of the device would of course have generated some of the variation in intensity seen in the plot.</div>
            <li>The camera parameter associated with the focus distance (<code>sony-manual-focus</code>) takes values in unspecified units.<ul>
                <li>Through the API, each camera does provide constants that specify the value of the parameter for a focus distance of one metre (<code>sony-manual-focus-for-1m</code>) and for infinite focus distance (<code>sony-manual-focus-for-infinity</code>).  After some rough experimentation, I concluded that given the value of the parameter, I might approximate the physical focus distance in metres as<br />(<code>sony-manual-focus-for-1m</code> &ndash; <code>sony-manual-focus-for-infinity</code>)/(<code>sony-manual-focus</code> &ndash; <code>sony-manual-focus-for-infinity</code>).<br />I use this expression to show approximate values of the selected focus distances in the app's on-screen interface.</li>
                <li>For a sequence of focus-autobracketed shots, I have the app hit an arithmetic progression of focus distance parameter values with the desired start, end, and number.  The resulting physical focus distances are thus non-uniformly spaced, with the separation between successive focus distances increasing with the focus distance.  This is not unreasonable or undesirable, since the depth of field also increases with the focus distance.</li>
                <li>Through the API, each camera specifies an extreme focus distance parameter value (<code>sony-max-manual-focus</code>) beyond the value it specifies for macro focus (<code>sony-manual-focus-for-macro</code>, which is the nearest focus setting in the stock camera app), and it specifies an opposite extreme value (<code>sony-min-manual-focus</code>) beyond the value it specifies for infinite focus distance (<code>sony-manual-focus-for-infinity</code>).  It is not clear whether these extreme values are reasonable or meaningful, so I limit my app to the interval bounded by the macro and infinity values.</li>
